    <h2>Family Involvement and Hands-On Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Families play a vital role in balancing technology use in early childhood education. 
      Encouraging children to explore outside of screens, participate in creative activities, 
      and engage in social play helps maintain healthy development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Teachers can involve families by sharing learning resources, suggesting home activities, 
      and organizing workshops to demonstrate effective ways to integrate technology 
      without overuse.
