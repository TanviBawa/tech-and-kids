    <h2>Early Childhood Education in Canada</h2>
    <p>
      Early Childhood Education (ECE) in Canada focuses on providing young children
      with opportunities to learn, explore, and grow in safe and engaging environments.
      In recent years, technology has become an important part of this process.
      Classrooms are now using <strong>smartboards, tablets, and educational apps</strong>
      to support learning through interactive methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology encourages creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving skills.
      However, it is important to balance screen time with hands-on experiences
      like outdoor play, social activities, and family involvement.
      Educators and families must work together to ensure that children receive
      the best of both digital and real-world learning.
